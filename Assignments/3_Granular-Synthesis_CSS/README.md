# Granular & Concatenative Sound Synthesis

Granular and Concatenative Synthesis are powerful techniques in the audio domain. The first one consists of dividing a sound source (an audio file, for instance) into small grains whose duration is smaller than 100ms. The second technique, as the name suggests, consists of concatenating short samples of recorded sounds, and it is used, for example, in speech synthesis.

This project consists of a composition, using these two techniques, created with Pure Data (Pd) and Reaper. The composition shows something similar to a soundscape, where the listener can experience a stormy, rainy day.

The final result is the *composition.wav* (or *composition.mp3*)
