# Monophonic Sonic Challenge

Sound synthesis techniques can be used to create music or parts of them. One great example of these techniques in the industry can be seen in On the Run from Pink Floydâ€™s Dark Side of the Moon.

This project consists of reproducing a snippet from this music, as well as learn the basics of Sound Synthesis.

The final result is the *on_the_run.wav* file under *attempts/*.
