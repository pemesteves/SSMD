# Digital Polyphonic Synthesizer

A Synthesizer is an electronic musical instrument that generates audio signals. There are two main types of synthesizers, analog and digital, and they both can be monophonic or polyphonic, depending on the number of notes they are capable of sounding.

This project consists of creating a Digital Polyphonic Synthesizer with Pure Data.

## Requirements

Pure Data and the following libraries:
- cyclone
- else
- audiolab
- moonlib

## How to Run

Open polyphonic-synthesizer.pd with Pure Data, and try the synthesizer.
