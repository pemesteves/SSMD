Projects made for the [Sound Synthesis for Digital Media](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=456338) course (1st year of the FEUP's [Master in Multimedia](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_curso_id=732&pv_ano_lectivo=2020)).

The course consisted of 3 assignments and a final project, all made individually.

Assignments:
- **Monophonic Sonic Challenge**: reproducing a snippet from *On The Run* (*Pink Floyd* - *Dark Side of the Moon*), as well as learning the basics of Sound Synthesis.
- **Digital Polyphonic Synthesizer**: a digital polyphonic synthesizer created with Pure Data.
- **Granular & Concatenative Sound Synthesis**: a composition, using granular and concatenative synthesis, created with Pure Data and Reaper.

Final Project:
- **Description**: An instrument, sound performance, and/or a sound-based work based on the ideas, technical challenges, and contents discussed during the semester.
- **Idea**: An audio game suitable for blind people.
- **Result**: ***Blind Death*** - a survival 3D shooter, within a small arena, without any visuals. The sound was produced with Sound Synthesis techniques.

Across this repository, you can see the mentioned assignments and the final project.
